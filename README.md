# Etch-A-Sketch
Using Event handling to draw with keyboard

The turtle does the following when keys (w, s, a, d and c) are pressed:
1) "w" -> moves forward
2) "s" -> moves backward
3) "a" -> rotates counter-clockwise
4) "d" -> rotates clockwise
5) "c" -> clears screen and turtle repositions to center

The screen exits when you click on it
